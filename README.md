#### Explosives Safety Quantity-Distance (qdmap) ðŸ’¥

I want to create an application for applying explosives safety quantity-distance (QD) criteria to create explosives safety site plans using free and open source software (QGIS).  The software should simplify the process for engineers and planners to ensure public safety.

Ideally it would be able to apply different explosives safety standards such as those implemented by NATO or U.S. Department of Defense.

### Interests

- Free and open source software.
- Linux

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
    - QGIS
